•	GraphDetectron visual relationship detection model based on graph neural networks to detect relationship triplets (subject, predicate, object) in images, in a weakly supervised manner. The dataset was manually collected, to up to 10,000 images with noisy labels, and the model achieved SOT results.
•	Agricultural-UNet segmentation model based on UNet model for very noisy agricultural satellite images to detect damages in fields crops. The model which was initially trained for medical imaging, and then fine-tuned to agricultural imaging which multi-label segmentation. The accuracy 
•	Spotify Music Recommendation song recommendation distributed model based on Spotify music meta-data and feature correspondence.
